## Privacy Policy for LocusPin

### Effective Date: 11-2025

LocusPin is committed to protecting your privacy as you enjoy our platform for sharing location-based content. This policy outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard your information.

### Information Collection

- Location Data: We collect GPS coordinates to provide relevant location-based posts. This information is essential for displaying nearby content and is only used to enhance your experience within the app.
- User Roles:
  - Anonymous Users: Can view posts only.
  - Regular Users: Can create normal and warning posts, and interact through likes, dislikes, and pinning posts.
  - Promoter Users: Can create events in addition to all regular user capabilities.
  - Business Users: Have complete access to all features, including viewing post statistics (views, comments, interaction rates, and URL clicks).

### Post Visibility

- Posts are visible to users within a specific GPS range, as well as  to anyone with the shared post URL. Always think before sharing  sensitive personal information, either in your posts or through  interactions.

### User Responsibilities

- Users must adhere to community guidelines and post responsibly.  Inappropriate content can be reported and subject to review. Posts  receiving excessive dislikes will be regulated to maintain a positive  environment.

### Data Security

- Information Security: We implement robust security  measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access  and misuse. While we strive to safeguard your data, we cannot guarantee  complete security due to inherent risks.

### Data Retention

- We retain your information as long as your account is active or as  necessary to provide services. When your data is no longer needed, we  will securely delete or anonymize it.

### Third-Party Sharing

- We do not share personal information with third parties without your  consent, except as required by law or to comply with legal obligations.  Posts shared externally via URL may be viewed by anyone with access to  that link.

### User Rights

- Users have the right to access, modify, or delete their personal  data. You can manage your privacy settings and control what information  you share directly through the app.

### Changes to This Policy

- We reserve the right to update this Policy. Any changes will be  posted on this page with an updated effective date. Continued use of the  app constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
